# Steps in using Aggregator:

# Register service with aggregator.
# Get USSD code (e.g. *384*123#).
# Provide your callback URL (e.g. https://yourapp.com/ussd).
# Aggregator routes all user input to your URL.
# Deploy your backend online (it must have HTTPS, e.g., using Render, Railway, or AWS).
# Handle user sessions â€” your backend should remember users by sessionId.
